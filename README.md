2StoreServerPy
==============

For client devices, such as Android mobile, usually it is limited amount of memory inside. 
It is easy to over the memory limited after take photos and videos, assume they all will sync to Server,
and this code will automatically move the data from mobile sync folder to another folder after detecting 
a 80% full of my mobile, then auto. clean the mobile by re-sync. So it will like the mobile always has 
memory for my photos and videos.
